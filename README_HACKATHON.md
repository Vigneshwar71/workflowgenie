## üèÜ Hackathon Challenge Addressed

**Theme 2: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Innovation Challenge**

WorkflowGenie addresses the MCP Innovation Challenge by creating a powerful workplace orchestration platform that leverages AI agents to automate complex cross-platform workflows. Our implementation utilizes the Cequence AI Gateway for secure MCP communication and exposes a production-ready MCP server for intelligent agents.

### How We've Used Cequence AI Gateway

Our MCP server integrates with Cequence AI Gateway to provide:

1. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security features to protect API endpoints
2. **Observability**: Detailed logging and monitoring of AI agent activity
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of abuse through intelligent rate limiting
4. **Authentication**: Secure integration with Descope for token validation
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all AI-initiated actions

The integration allows for secure proxy access from AI agents (like Claude) to our backend services while maintaining proper authentication, authorization, and audit trails.

## üîß What We Built

WorkflowGenie is an MCP server that provides workplace automation tools to AI agents. Our primary focus is on a complete code review orchestration workflow that spans multiple platforms:

1. **Code Review Scheduling**: End-to-end integration across GitHub, Slack, Google Calendar, and Notion
   - Fetches PR details and involved developers from GitHub
   - Creates dedicated Slack channels for review discussions
   - Finds optimal meeting time based on reviewers' calendar availability
   - Schedules calendar events with video conferencing
   - Creates Notion pages with code review checklists and context
   - Links all systems together for seamless navigation

2. **Security and Enterprise Focus**:
   - Built on Cequence AI Gateway for enterprise-grade API security
   - Implemented with Descope Authentication for secure OAuth flows
   - Designed with proper permission scoping and audit logging

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **MCP Implementation**: MCP SDK with Cequence AI Gateway integration
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Integrations**:
  - GitHub: @octokit/rest for GitHub API interactions
  - Slack: @slack/web-api for Slack workspace integration
  - Google Calendar: googleapis for scheduling and calendar management
  - Notion: @notionhq/client for documentation and tracking
- **Security**: Cequence AI Gateway + Descope Authentication
- **Deployment**: Containerized with Docker, deployable to Fly.io, Render, or any container platform

## üåê Smithery MCP Server Link

Access our MCP server on Smithery: [https://smithery.ai/workflowgenie](https://smithery.ai/your_smithery_id)

### Using the MCP Server with Claude

1. In Claude Desktop, enable Developer Settings
2. Add our Smithery MCP URL as a custom server
3. Use the "schedule_code_review" tool to coordinate GitHub pull request reviews

Example prompt:
```
Schedule a code review for pull request #123 in the repository "codecraft/project-alpha" with high urgency.
```

### Connecting to the MCP Server via the API

You can also connect directly to our MCP server using HTTP requests:

```bash
# List available tools
curl -X POST https://smithery.ai/your_smithery_id/v1/tools/list \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Call a tool
curl -X POST https://smithery.ai/your_smithery_id/v1/tools/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"schedule_code_review","arguments":{"pr_number":"123","repository":"codecraft/project-alpha","urgency":"high"}}'
```

## üìã How to Run Locally
